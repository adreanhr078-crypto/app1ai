  End-to-end 11.11 production pipeline for Blender-authored GLB assets,
  cinematic frame sequences, optimized WebM/MP4, image validation, and
  Three/R3F integration. Use for any 3D, cinematic, model, texture, or
  production-media change. Preserve Canon and server-owned gameplay.

# 11.11 3D Pipeline

The React/Cloudflare application remains the authoritative service and UI shell.
Godot is the Owner-selected production runtime for third-person play; Three/R3F
is the temporary opening reference until the bounded parity gate passes. Blender
authors validated GLB assets. Never keep two shipped gameplay runtimes.

## Required lifecycle

1. Run `npm run agent:preflight` from `artifacts/eleven-eleven`.
2. Read `AGENT_RULES.md`, the UI visual contract, Blender pipeline reference,
   and the current Canon source register.
3. Run `npm run env:check` from the repository root.
4. Use the lightest format that earns its cost:
   - React/CSS for live UI and readable text.
   - Sprites/static layers for parallax.
   - WebM/MP4 plus poster for fixed cinematics.
   - GLB only for interaction that benefits from real-time depth.
5. Export to ignored intermediate storage, validate, optimize, validate again,
   then publish only the approved optimized output.
6. Integrate with lazy loading, reserved dimensions, loading/error fallback,
   Reduced Motion, mute, and a non-WebGL fallback.
7. Run `npm run media:validate`, browser/runtime verification when applicable,
   and the mandatory autonomous quality gate.

## Canon and draft rules

- The approved Story Bible is an evolving Canon source; draft Manhwa pages are
  visual direction until their dialogue and final sequence are locked.
- Do not bake readable Arabic/English UI text into Blender, images, or video.
- Echo's approved direct-skin neck mark is `EX-011`; keep it as a replaceable
  decal so Zero corruption can evolve around it without replacing the mark.
- Zero appears only according to the Story Bible's progressive reveal rule.
- Generated concepts are not production assets until source, rights, visual
  continuity, performance, and integration are documented.

## Commands

```bash
npm run env:check
npm run media:smoke
npm run media:validate
npm run blender:doctor
npm run blender:export-gltf -- --blend scene.blend --output model.raw.glb
npm run gltf:validate -- --input model.raw.glb --strict
npm run gltf:optimize -- --input model.raw.glb --output model.glb --profile character --texture-mode ktx2
npm run cinematic:encode -- --input frame_%04d.png --output scene.webm --poster scene.webp --fps 24
```

`media:smoke` must prove Blender scene creation, GLB export, Khronos validation,
Meshopt/KTX preparation, Blender re-import, PNG rendering, FFmpeg encoding, and
poster extraction without requiring system installation.

## Production budgets

The source of truth is `tools/media/asset-budgets.json`. Do not weaken budgets
to make an asset pass. Optimize the asset or document a measured exception.
Interactive character clips must resolve at least Idle, Walk, Run, and
Interact. One rig may produce GLB, a Mini Echo sprite atlas, and fixed WebM.

## Tool policy

- Required: portable Blender, FFmpeg/ffprobe, portable KTX tools, pinned glTF
  Transform, Khronos validator, Sharp, and Microsoft Edge.
- ImageMagick is optional; Sharp is the supported fallback.
- ComfyUI custom nodes are installed, but generation remains blocked until the
  licensed checkpoint, VAE, IPAdapter, ControlNet, and motion weights pass the
  recorded smoke gate. Connected applications may support concepts under the
  rights and credit rules.
- Audacity is deferred until approved VO/SFX exists.

## Frozen authority

Do not modify puzzle solutions, rewards, receipts, achievements, progression,
authentication, story endings, or Canon state from presentation tooling.
