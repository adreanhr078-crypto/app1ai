# 11.11 Hybrid Production Toolchain

## Runtime decision

The React/Cloudflare application remains the authoritative service, account,
Manhwa, and accessible UI shell. Blender authors characters, environments,
animation, and fixed cinematic frames. Godot 4.7.2 is the Owner-selected
production runtime for third-person play; Three.js/React Three Fiber is the
temporary opening reference until the bounded parity gate passes. Unity remains
closed unless the Owner reopens the engine decision.

This decision preserves login, server-owned rewards, puzzles, progression,
Arabic/English UI, and the existing browser/mobile reach while allowing one
character rig to produce:

- optimized GLB for third-person play;
- a small sprite atlas for Mini Echo;
- WebM/MP4 for fixed cinematic moments.

## Canon source contract

The current authority is
`docs/internal/narrative/current/ar/manifest.json`. Both approved inputs are
retained:

- Story Bible: facts, rules, relationships, reveal order, and global arc.
- Narrative Master: dramatic sequencing, emotional cadence, and scene intent.

The removed `Long Fall` archive is no longer authority. Current Manhwa pages
dated 2026-08-28 are draft visual references until their text and page order are
approved. Their embedded identifiers do not override the locked direct-skin
Echo neck mark `EX-011`. Zero uses an additive evolving visual layer around the
mark; it does not replace it.

## Draft visual direction

The supplied pages establish a strong target:

- obsidian architecture and near-black character silhouettes;
- violet memory/signal energy as the dominant supernatural material;
- crimson used sparingly for danger, transformation, and Zero pressure;
- wet reflective laboratory floors, glass chambers, cables, and digital rain;
- fractured-glass and data-disintegration motifs for memory transitions;
- warm domestic memory light as an emotional contrast to the laboratory;
- high-contrast anime faces with stable Echo/Yuki facial continuity.

Do not let violet consume all interactions. Live UI should remain primarily
black/ivory/crimson 11.11, with violet for memory/system phenomena and cyan only
for legibility-critical signals. Color is never the sole carrier of meaning.

## Portable tools

No system installer is required by the pipeline.

| Capability       | Production path                                     |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Blender          | `BLENDER_EXE`, verified portable Blender 5.2 LTS    |
| FFmpeg           | `FFMPEG_EXE` and `FFPROBE_EXE`                      |
| KTX2             | `TOKTX_EXE`, verified portable KTX 4.4.2            |
| GLB optimization | pinned `@gltf-transform/cli` 4.4.2                  |
| GLB validation   | pinned Khronos `gltf-validator`                     |
| Image inspection | pinned Sharp; ImageMagick optional                  |
| Browser QA       | `EDGE_EXE`; Microsoft Edge only                     |
| Production engine | `GODOT_EXE`; verified portable Godot 4.7.2 Standard |

Run:

```bash
npm run env:check
npm run media:smoke
npm run media:validate
npm run godot:doctor
npm run godot:smoke
```

`media:smoke` must pass the entire non-Canon test chain: Blender scene creation,
raw GLB export, strict validation, Meshopt/KTX preparation, strict validation,
Blender re-import, PNG render, VP9 WebM encode, poster extraction, and ffprobe.

## Godot bounded production-foundation contract

Godot 4.7.2 Standard is verified from its official Windows x86*64 ZIP at
`C:/Tools/Godot-4.7.2-stable`. The archive SHA-512 matches the official release
checksum and `\_sc*`keeps editor state self-contained beside the executable.
The exact artifact, hashes, and restrictions are recorded in`tools/godot/godot-toolchain.manifest.json`.

The bounded `sector-11-foundation` project is authorized for character, camera,
movement, animation, interaction, lighting, and parity evidence. No .NET build,
export templates, broad world, combat, final Canon environment, or gameplay
authority is authorized. Godot is measured against the existing reference for
startup time, frame time, peak memory, input, GLB animation, build size,
streaming, thermals, accessibility, bilingual UI, and receipt integration.
Three/R3F freezes as a reference only after Godot passes; the project will not
maintain duplicate shipped gameplay engines.

## Unity readiness contract

Unity is prepared as an optional measured engine candidate, not selected as the
current runtime. The pinned evaluation target is Unity 6.3 LTS
`6000.3.23f1` (`09d2ecc7fb28`). The exact official source and restrictions are
recorded in `tools/unity/unity-toolchain.manifest.json`.

Windows does not have an official portable Unity Editor ZIP. The official
Windows artifact is an EXE installer, and Personal licensing normally requires
interactive Unity ID activation. Do not unpack the installer and call the
result portable, do not store a license or credentials in the repository, and
do not treat the experimental Unity CLI as a production dependency.

After the engine greenlight, install the pinned Editor in a dedicated location,
set `UNITY_EXE` to its exact executable, and run:

```bash
npm run unity:doctor
npm run unity:typecheck
npm run unity:test
```

Start with the Editor only. Add Windows, Web, or Android build modules only
after a measured proof needs them. Availability never changes the current
`WAITING_FOR_FINAL_MANHWA` phase or authorizes a second gameplay authority.

The Owner has declined installing Unity on the current machine. Do not download
or run its installer unless a later explicit Owner instruction changes that
decision. The active local 3D production path is portable Blender plus Godot,
with the existing Three/R3F slice retained only for parity evidence. A future
Unity comparison requires a new Owner decision.

## Asset flow

```text
art/blender/source/        editable approved scenes
art/blender/scripts/       deterministic scene/rig automation
.tmp/                      ignored smoke and working output
art/blender/intermediate/  ignored raw exports
art/blender/renders/       ignored frame sequences
art/blender/exports/       ignored candidate exports
public/assets/             optimized, versioned runtime output only
```

Do not publish raw `.blend`, frame sequences, or unvalidated GLB. Never put
readable UI text or authoritative game state inside Blender output.

## Budgets

`tools/media/asset-budgets.json` is the machine-enforced source of truth.
Initial limits include:

- interactive GLB: 6 MiB, 80k triangles, 32 meshes, 16 materials, 128 joints;
- still image: 2.6 MiB, 4096px maximum dimension;
- fixed cinematic: 10 MiB, 1920×1080, VP9/H.264 and Opus/AAC;
- optional mobile third-person download: 15 MiB;
- mobile slice: 80 draw calls, 220 MiB runtime memory, stable 30fps.

Do not weaken these limits to make an asset pass. Optimize or request a measured
exception with Edge runtime evidence.

## Character contract

The final Echo/Yuki production rigs are not yet complete. Required baseline:

- one armature, no more than 128 bones;
- Idle, Walk, Run, and Interact clips with runtime-resolvable names;
- optional Turn, Look, PointHelp, Talk, and Celebrate clips;
- direct-skin identifier decal as a replaceable mesh/material layer;
- Echo uses `EX-011`; Zero corruption is a separate animated mask/material;
- mobile LODs and texture variants;
- GLB re-import and browser animation verification before publication.

## Connected creative applications

Canva, Figma, image generation, Magnific, HeyGen, and music/video applications
may support moodboards, concepts, storyboards, upscale tests, and previs.
Nothing becomes a production asset until its rights, source, Canon continuity,
performance budget, accessible fallback, and gameplay integration are recorded.
No voice or music from another anime may be copied.

The local ComfyUI custom nodes are present, but generation is blocked until
licensed compatible checkpoint, VAE, IPAdapter, ControlNet, and motion weights
pass a recorded smoke workflow. Audacity is deferred until approved VO/SFX exists.

## Approved Part 1 handoff and production gate

1. Attach the full ordered pages and final Arabic text separately.
2. Assign a publication version and file hashes.
3. Resolve page-level identities, chronology, tattoo visibility, and Zero reveal.
4. Create bilingual transcripts and visual descriptions outside the artwork.
5. Map each puzzle to a specific shown clue; remove stale puzzles.
6. Storyboard only the cinematic moments that gain value from motion.
7. Lock Echo/Yuki turnarounds before final sculpt, rig, or facial blendshapes.
8. Produce one 20–30 minute hybrid slice before expanding the world.
