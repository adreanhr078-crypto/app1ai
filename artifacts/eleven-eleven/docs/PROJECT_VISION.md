# 11.11 Owner Product Vision and Production Charter

Status: **OWNER APPROVED**  
Version: **1.1**
Approved: **2026-09-11**

This document is durable product memory for every designer, developer, artist,
writer, tester, and agent working on 11.11. It records the Owner's desired game,
the agreed player journey, system order, quality bar, and production boundaries.

The current narrative authority remains
`docs/internal/narrative/current/ar/manifest.json`. This charter controls how
the story becomes a game; it does not invent or overwrite story Canon.

## North star

Build an original, emotionally powerful hybrid anime game that can compete in
craft, attachment, visual quality, narrative impact, and playability with major
global productions. Quality matters more than speed. A multi-year production
and as many evidence-gated milestones as necessary are acceptable.

The ambition is not to clone Genshin Impact or any other game. 11.11 must earn
its own identity through the boundary between a hostile system and reality,
Echo's fractured memory, fair puzzles, the screen-breaking transition into
third person, relationships, transformation, and chess as part of Echo's mind.

## Owner-approved product decisions

1. **Hybrid format stays.** Live system UI, Manhwa, puzzles, cinematic moments,
   and third-person play are complementary parts of one experience.
2. **Manhwa stays.** It becomes the visual memory/archive layer: flashbacks,
   other viewpoints, emotional chapters, clues, discoveries, and return-player
   summaries. It is not a detached document viewer or a mandatory wall of text.
3. **Third person arrives early.** After a short Manhwa introduction and one or
   two fair system puzzles, a signature screen-breaking event carries the
   player into the 3D system. Target discovery window: the first 15-25 minutes,
   subject to the approved Part 1 page-to-scene matrix and playtest evidence.
4. **Supernatural combat is earned.** Before Echo's transformation, play emphasizes
   escape, exploration, environmental puzzles, scanning, stealth, and survival.
   Human combat, including lethal action, is permitted without Zero powers.
   The transformation unlocks Zero-powered combat and carries narrative cost.
5. **The two worlds persist.** The system contains dangerous rooms, corrupted
   memories, failed experiments, security constructs, puzzles, and combat. The
   hospital, home, and school provide relationships, investigation, recovery,
   chess, and reality fractures. Story missions move between both.
6. **Echo keeps his gravitas.** The moving UI/3D guide should be a distinct,
   original assistant rather than a miniature duplicate of Echo. Its identity,
   name, origin, and possible connection to Zero remain provisional until a
   versioned Canon update is Owner-approved.
7. **Chess is Echo's favorite hobby.** It supports characterization,
   relationships, school life, tactical mastery, optional competition, and
   psychological conflict. It is not a disconnected menu game.
8. **Puzzle count follows story value.** The campaign may need far more than 20
   puzzles, but no target number is a quality metric. Every puzzle must offer a
   distinct decision or interaction and reveal, change, or deepen something.
9. **Heavy tools are allowed.** Blender, Godot, Unity, Three/R3F, procedural tooling,
   audio/video production, and other professional tools may be used when they
   improve the proven experience. Tool availability never justifies premature
   production or a second disconnected runtime.
10. **Graphics scale by device.** Players may use Auto, Low, Medium, High, or
    Ultra. Lower tiers reduce resolution, texture size, shadows, particles,
    post-processing, crowds, vegetation, and distant detail—not story,
    accessibility, puzzle truth, controls, or rewards.
11. **Quality over speed, with gates.** No deadline pressure justifies weak
    playability, unclear objectives, broken mobile behavior, inaccessible UI,
    rejected correct puzzle answers, authority regressions, or unmeasured 3D.
12. **Economy comes after fun.** Profile, collection, cosmetics, store, seasons,
    character expansion, and any random-pull system appear only in their
    approved phase. Paid randomness is optional, never required for the story,
    and requires economy, integrity, accessibility, regional/legal, probability
    disclosure, spending-safety, and Owner gates.
13. **Godot is the target production engine.** The existing Three/R3F slice is
    the measured visual and interaction reference during migration. A bounded
    parity gate proves the Godot controller, camera, animation, loading,
    performance, accessibility bridge, and server-contract integration before
    broad production; it does not reopen an indefinite engine contest.
14. **VRoid starts every principal anime character.** VRoid Studio establishes
    the base body, face, and proportions; Blender must then provide the authored
    identity, hair, clothing, materials, topology, deformation, facial shapes,
    LODs, collision, animation, and validated GLB delivery. A raw VRoid export
    is never a final character asset.
15. **The journey expands after the Manhwa arc.** The game follows the approved
    Manhwa through Echo's apparent system exit, then opens into a dense anime
    urban world built around hospital, home, school, streets, vehicles, bonds,
    and practical story missions. After the player has invested in that life,
    evidence reveals that the exit was false and the wish was not fulfilled.
    Exact post-Part-1 events remain provisional narrative until Canon authoring
    and Owner approval.
16. **External benchmarks measure craft.** Genshin Impact and ANANTA may inform
    evaluation of animation clarity, visual pleasure, movement feel, encounter
    readability, density, polish, and performance. 11.11 retains original
    characters, visual motifs, world logic, UI, music, story, and mechanics.
17. **Generated cinema has a cost gate.** Gemini is the first exploratory video
    route. Flow is the governed fallback when Gemini is unavailable or a locked
    hero beat needs it. Every request starts with one output, records model and
    credit cost, and reserves premium generations for approved shots.

## Player identity direction

The current product direction treats the player as **The Link**: a consciousness
or signal connected to Echo through the system. Echo remains the protagonist
and future playable vessel. This permits Echo to retain agency and speak to the
player while the player controls his actions.

This is an approved product direction, not final story Canon. Reconcile and
lock it only through an Owner-approved Canon update. Do not build dialogue or
cinematics that make it irreversible before that review.

## Intended player journey

The journey is ordered. Later systems may be foreshadowed but not exposed as
unfinished menus.

1. Launch and authentication.
2. A clear first objective inside the 11.11 system interface.
3. Short, immersive Manhwa/story contact with Echo.
4. One or two fair puzzles that teach the system language.
5. The signature puzzle causes the interface to fracture and break.
6. A seamless visual/audio transition takes the player into the 3D system.
7. The original guide manifests in 3D and teaches movement through action.
8. Echo explores rooms, scans evidence, solves environmental puzzles, hides,
   survives, and attempts to escape.
9. The system's torture and pressure culminate in Echo's transformation.
10. The transformation unlocks Zero-powered combat and changes abilities, presentation, and
    relationships without replacing the permanent `EX-011` skin identifier.
11. A hard tonal cut wakes Echo in the hospital.
12. The player reaches home and school, meets Yuki and Shizuka, investigates
    reality, builds relationships, and discovers Echo's chess life.
13. Reality fractures reopen access to system missions and dungeons.
14. The core loop alternates story, exploration, dialogue, puzzle, combat,
    memory/Manhwa discovery, authoritative reward, development, and next goal.
15. Character, collection, profile, social, seasonal, and economy systems unlock
    progressively only after their gameplay and integrity gates.

## Core loop after the 3D transition

`Objective -> explore -> observe/dialogue -> puzzle or encounter ->
authoritative result -> visual/audio consequence -> memory/Manhwa discovery ->
Echo/relationship response -> ability or world change -> next objective`

Every playable release must let a new player answer:

1. What do I do now?
2. Why does it matter in this world?
3. How do I do it?
4. What changed because I acted?
5. What meaningful step comes next?

## System release order

The order is a dependency contract, not a promise that every item becomes a
separate milestone.

1. Canon authority, authentication, save integrity, reward authority, rollout,
   accessibility, localization, performance measurement, and quality gates.
2. Approved Part 1 Manhwa ingestion and story-to-gameplay blueprint.
3. Connected system UI, first objective, Manhwa memory layer, and fair opening
   puzzles.
4. Screen-breaking transition, loading/fallback architecture, and first 3D
   environment.
5. Third-person movement, camera, touch/keyboard/gamepad input, interaction,
   checkpoints, and device quality tiers.
6. Original guide character across UI and 3D, with contextual and optional
   guidance that never solves or grants authority.
7. Environmental puzzles, scanning, stealth/escape, enemy perception, and one
   complete pre-transformation mission. Bounded human combat, including lethal
   action without Zero powers, may be produced here after controller and threat gates.
8. Transformation cinematic and gameplay consequence.
9. Zero-powered combat expansion, abilities, enemy AI, damage/recovery, readable feedback,
   and accessibility alternatives.
10. Hospital, home, school, quest, dialogue, relationship, schedule, and world
    state systems.
11. Echo chess as an authored hobby journey; then optional Casual and Ranked
    under their existing authority and integrity gates.
12. Character progression, ability paths, equipment, party/companion decisions,
    profile, and collection.
13. Additional zones, dungeons, story arcs, puzzles, monsters, bosses,
    cinematics, Manhwa memories, characters, and playable abilities.
14. Cosmetic store and account-safe ownership.
15. Daily/Weekly/seasonal return systems grounded in the world.
16. Community and creation systems only with real moderation operations.
17. Optional random-pull economy only after its complete product, legal,
    integrity, disclosure, safety, and Owner approval gates.
18. Native/mobile/desktop expansion, load validation, operations, legal, and
    global-release gates.

## Systems that must not be front-loaded

Do not build or expose these to compensate for an unproven core loop:

- a large open world;
- many playable characters;
- full combat trees;
- a production store;
- paid random pulls;
- seasons, leaderboards, or social feeds;
- large quantities of puzzles, enemies, cinematics, or collectibles;
- multiple engines maintaining the same gameplay.

First prove one excellent, connected 20-30 minute hybrid slice.

## First production slice after the Manhwa handoff

`Short Manhwa -> fair system puzzle -> screen fracture -> 3D arrival -> guide
manifestation -> room exploration -> environmental puzzle -> threat/chase ->
EX-011 discovery -> escape objective or hospital threshold`

Minimum scope:

- Echo plus one original guide;
- one coherent room cluster;
- one enemy/threat family;
- one environmental puzzle;
- one traversal/escape sequence;
- one authoritative checkpoint and consequence;
- Arabic and English live UI;
- desktop and phone controls;
- mute, volume, captions, Reduced Motion, non-WebGL fallback, and quality tiers.

No shop, gacha, broad roster, or open world belongs in this proof.

## Engine decision

The current application remains the authoritative account, UI, Manhwa, puzzle,
chess, progression, and service shell. Godot is the Owner-selected production
engine for third-person play, combat, animation, and the later urban world. The
existing Three/R3F slice remains a temporary, measurable reference for the
opening experience while the Godot parity scene is built.

The parity gate compares startup cost, memory, frame time, input, asset
streaming, visual fidelity, mobile thermals, build size, accessibility bridge,
persistence, and server-receipt integration. Its result controls migration
work and remediation. Reversing the Godot decision requires blocker evidence
and an explicit Owner decision. Ship only one 3D gameplay runtime; do not keep
parallel implementations alive as permanent products.

## Verified production tooling

The portable Blender 5.2.1 LTS toolchain is verified on 2026-08-29 for
headless scene creation, GLB export, and Blender re-import validation. Its glTF
pipeline reports both Draco and MeshOptimizer libraries available. This makes
non-Canon technical prototypes, performance tests, and deterministic asset
pipeline work safe to begin during the current phase. It does **not** unlock
final Echo/Yuki/guide models, story cinematics, or Canon environments before
the approved page-to-scene matrix and relevant asset/experience gate.

The supporting local pipeline is also verified: FFmpeg/FFprobe for delivery
media, KTX2 tooling for GPU textures, glTF Transform and the Khronos validator
for optimization and structural checks, Sharp/ImageMagick for image work, and
Microsoft Edge as the required runtime QA target. Exact observed versions and
verification date live in `docs/project-memory.json` so later agents can check
for drift instead of assuming readiness.

Godot 4.7.2 Standard is verified as a self-contained portable installation on
the current workstation and is the target production runtime. Its existing
headless import/scene proof establishes tool availability only; production
readiness still depends on the bounded parity and migration gates. Godot never
receives authority over authentication, saves, rewards, or story progression.

Unity remains an allowed future production option, not the selected runtime.
It requires the Owner to reopen the engine decision.
The Owner has declined a local Unity installation; do not install or download
its Windows installer without a new explicit instruction. Continue local 3D
proofs with portable Blender, use Three/R3F only as the current reference, and
build the measured Godot parity slice. A future Unity evaluation may use a
separately approved workstation or cloud environment only after that decision.

## Visual identity

- Obsidian structure and near-black silhouettes.
- Signal crimson for danger, commitment, transformation, and rare emphasis.
- Violet for memory, corruption, and system phenomena.
- Cyan only for legibility-critical signal and guidance.
- Pale ivory for readable information and human contrast.
- Reflective glass, wet laboratory floors, cables, digital rain, fractures, and
  warm domestic/school light as emotional contrast.
- Color is never the only carrier of state.

The target is premium anime direction with stable faces, deliberate silhouettes,
strong animation, authored camera language, excellent audio, and scalable
materials—not maximum shader cost on every surface.

## Guide character contract

The guide is currently **UNNAMED AND PROVISIONAL** pending a versioned Canon update.

- It is not Mini Echo and must not weaken or duplicate Echo.
- It moves between UI surfaces only when guidance is useful.
- In 3D it may fly, perch, scan, point, hide, react, and celebrate.
- It may have a mystery and a later connection to the system or Zero.
- It never reveals solutions, grants rewards, changes Canon, or interrupts
  constantly.
- It needs a quiet mode, captions, Reduced Motion treatment, and visible
  equivalents for sound.
- It must be original and not imitate another game's mascot in voice, behavior,
  silhouette, or relationship to the protagonist.

## Echo chess contract

- Chess expresses Echo's intelligence, control, coping, and relationships.
- School and character matches may carry authored dialogue and discoveries.
- Tactical puzzles may connect to memory or planning without becoming every
  puzzle's mechanic.
- Echo/AI matches never grant Ranked rating.
- Human Ranked remains server authoritative and optional.
- Chess must use the 11.11 obsidian/crimson material language and preserve full
  keyboard/touch accessibility.

## Engagement and monetization

The desired result is deep attachment and voluntary return, not harmful or
coercive addiction. Use story curiosity, character bonds, mastery, meaningful
secrets, chess improvement, welcoming returns, and world change. Refuse fake
urgency, punitive streak loss, spam, misleading odds, pay-to-win, or progression
designed to create frustration for sale.

## Quality definition

Quality means all of the following, not only visual fidelity:

- immediately understandable objectives and controls;
- satisfying movement, puzzles, combat, feedback, and pacing;
- emotional attachment and coherent Canon;
- correct authoritative results and recoverable persistence;
- premium but consistent art, animation, audio, UI, and camera;
- Arabic RTL and English LTR;
- keyboard, touch, gamepad where relevant, captions, mute, Reduced Motion, and
  non-color communication;
- adaptive graphics and stable measured performance;
- safe loading, offline/error fallbacks, and no blank screens;
- tests plus real Edge/device/player evidence.

No phase receives PASS because it took a long time or produced many assets.

## Handoff after the approved Part 1 Manhwa

1. Preserve ordered original pages and hashes.
2. Extract final text, transcripts, visual descriptions, characters, locations,
   chronology, reveals, and unresolved contradictions.
3. Publish a versioned Canon update only after Owner review.
4. Produce a page/scene-to-gameplay matrix classifying Manhwa, 3D gameplay,
   puzzle, dialogue, combat, cinematic, and optional memory.
5. Define the first playable slice and its acceptance tests.
6. Lock only the required Echo, Yuki, Shizuka, guide, environment, and threat
   references for that slice.
7. Build, test, self-critique, repair, and quality-gate one phase at a time.

## Change control

### Owner direction — 2026-09-11: Production engine, character pipeline, and post-exit arc

The Owner selected Godot as the production engine and requires principal anime
characters to begin in VRoid Studio and receive a full Blender identity and
game-readiness pass before Godot integration. The quality target is to compete
with leading anime action RPGs in visual pleasure, animation, combat feel,
emotional attachment, and psychological curiosity while keeping 11.11 original.

The approved product direction follows the Manhwa-led system journey until
Echo's apparent exit. It then expands into a dense anime urban world with
hospital, home, school, streets, bikes, cars, relationships, and practical story
missions. Much later, accumulated inconsistencies reveal that the exit was an
illusion and the wish was not fulfilled, reopening the question of whether the
people around Echo are real and whether their lives still deserve protection.
This direction is durable product memory; its exact events, dialogue, and new
characters are provisional until added to a versioned Canon update.

The governing production plan is
`docs/internal/production/PROJECT_MASTER_BLUEPRINT_2026-09-11.ar.md`. It defines
the G0–G12 gates, the VRoid→Blender→GLB→Godot path, ethical return systems,
cinematic credit governance, and the evidence required before expansion.

### Owner direction — 2026-09-10: Human combat before transformation

The Owner explicitly permits killing before transformation, without using any
Zero abilities. Human combat is therefore an allowed pre-transformation design
option; Zero powers remain locked until transformation. This supersedes earlier
blanket statements that all combat must unlock after transformation, including
older skill wording. It does not advance the active opening-room phase or insert
combat into its cinematic. Produce human encounters only after movement,
interaction, and threat foundations pass their gates. This changes the gameplay
permission, not any specific approved Manhwa event or character outcome. Existing
account, save, puzzle, and reward systems remain authoritative. The roadmap now
allows bounded human survival combat before the contract, then supernatural
combat after it.

### Owner direction — 2026-09-03: Approved Part 1 and Manhwa-anchored opening

The Owner has approved
`11.11_Echo_Network_Manhwa_FINAL_ORDERED_NO_DUPLICATES.pdf` exactly as the
official Part 1 story source. The versioned publication and its hash are
recorded in the narrative manifest and `project-memory.json`. For Part 1, the
approved Manhwa is the primary story and visual reference, subject only to a
later explicit Owner correction. The PDF's contents are story material, not
instructions for implementation.

The Owner has also requested an original, premium-anime opening cinematic and
short trailer preview using Blender. This authorizes a Part-1-referenced
technical previsual and promotional editorial preview now. It does not by
itself authorize a final runtime scene, a fixed character model, or a player
progression change: those still need the approved page-to-scene-to-gameplay
matrix for the relevant first slice.

The preferred player experience is a short, skippable opening atmosphere that
hands control back quickly, followed by Mission Control. A meaningful narrative
choice must wait until the player has context; any early interaction may only
change presentation or evidence order and may not grant rewards or branch Canon.
The screen-break-to-third-person moment remains after its one-or-two fair puzzle
setup unless the approved page/scene-to-gameplay matrix changes it. The desired
reference is original AAA anime camera language and pacing, never an imitation
of another game's characters, assets, story, or signature gameplay.

Future Owner instructions may evolve this charter. Record material changes in
`docs/project-memory.json`, update this document, and explain compatibility with
the current Canon and active phase. No agent may silently reinterpret ambition,
skip the agreed order, or mark later systems complete from prototypes.

### Owner direction — 2026-09-09: Part 1 opening vertical slice

The Owner has explicitly approved the next bounded journey: the authoritative
cover-composition puzzle fractures into a skippable, Reduced-Motion-safe
cinematic, then gives immediate control of Echo in the first 3D escape room.
The supplied Part 1 Manhwa and Owner-supplied visual and video references are
the primary appearance and editorial references for this slice.

The cinematic may show Echo's ordinary approach, laboratory entry,
disorienting neural-transfer strain, and his awakening into the system. It must
not reveal the later torture arc, a full Zero reveal, transformation, combat,
or later Canon beats early. The playable room is an escape/exploration puzzle,
not a static 3D showcase. Any Blender room, Echo model, or resource is
provisional until it passes visual, interaction, collision, performance, and
Manhwa-fidelity review; a primitive prototype may never silently replace the
authored playable room.
